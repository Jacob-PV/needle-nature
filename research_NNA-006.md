### Scientific Perspective
- No anatomical structures correspond to meridians
- Some theories suggest fascia, nervous system, or bioelectrical pathways may correlate
- Acupuncture effectiveness demonstrated for pain, nausea, some other conditions
- Mechanism may involve endorphin release, nervous system modulation, placebo effect
- Research continues to investigate physiological basis

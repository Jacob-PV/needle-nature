Nausea affects people from many causes: pregnancy, motion sickness, chemotherapy, post-surgery, and more. The P6 (Neiguan) acupressure point offers well-researched relief for various types of nausea.

## The P6 Point: Your Natural Anti-Nausea Tool

### Location

The P6 point is located on the inner forearm, about three finger-widths below the wrist crease, between two prominent tendons.

**How to find it:**
1. Place three fingers across your wrist
2. Feel for the space just below where your third finger rests
3. You should feel two tendons—P6 is between them

### Technique

**Method 1: Finger Pressure**
1. Use your thumb on opposite wrist
2. Apply firm, steady pressure for 2-3 minutes
3. Repeat on other wrist
4. Use as needed throughout the day

**Method 2: Acupressure Bands**
- Wristbands with a plastic stud positioned over P6
- Wear continuously for ongoing nausea prevention
- Available at most pharmacies (often called "Sea-Bands")

## Research Evidence

P6 acupressure is one of the most well-studied complementary therapies:

- **Morning sickness:** Studies show significant nausea reduction in pregnancy
- **Chemotherapy nausea:** Research supports P6 as adjunct to anti-nausea medication
- **Post-operative nausea:** Multiple trials demonstrate effectiveness
- **Motion sickness:** Evidence supports prevention and treatment

## Types of Nausea Addressed

### Morning Sickness
- Use P6 point before getting out of bed
- Keep acupressure bands on throughout the day
- Combine with small, frequent meals

### Motion Sickness
- Apply pressure 30 minutes before travel
- Wear acupressure bands during journey
- Reapply pressure as needed

### Chemotherapy-Related
- Start before treatment sessions
- Use in combination with prescribed anti-nausea medications
- Continue as needed between treatments

### Post-Operative
- Use as soon as nausea begins
- Safe alongside medications
- No drug interactions

## Additional Supportive Points

**Stomach 36 (ST36)**
- Located four finger-widths below kneecap, one finger-width outside shinbone
- Helps digestive function and nausea

**Conception Vessel 12 (CV12)**
- Midway between navel and bottom of breastbone
- Apply gentle circular pressure

## Safety Considerations

P6 acupressure is very safe:
- No drug interactions
- Safe during pregnancy (unlike some acupuncture points)
- Can be used as often as needed
- Side effects are minimal (possible mild tenderness)

**When to seek medical care:**
- Severe, persistent vomiting
- Signs of dehydration
- Vomiting blood
- Severe abdominal pain

## The Bottom Line

P6 acupressure provides a simple, evidence-based tool for nausea relief. Whether using finger pressure or acupressure bands, this technique offers drug-free relief you can use anytime, anywhere.

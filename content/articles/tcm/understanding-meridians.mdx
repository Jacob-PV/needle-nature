Meridians are fundamental to understanding Traditional Chinese Medicine and acupuncture. This guide explains what meridians are, both from traditional and modern perspectives.

## What Are Meridians?

In TCM theory, meridians (also called channels) are pathways through which vital energy (qi) flows throughout the body. Think of them as an intricate network connecting all parts of the body—organs, tissues, and systems.

### The 12 Primary Meridians

Each primary meridian:
- Connects to a specific organ system
- Follows a specific pathway through the body
- Contains multiple acupuncture points along its route
- Has peak activity during specific times of day

**Yin Meridians** (flow upward):
- Lung, Heart, Pericardium (chest to hands)
- Spleen, Kidney, Liver (feet to chest)

**Yang Meridians** (flow downward):
- Large Intestine, Small Intestine, Triple Warmer (hands to face)
- Stomach, Bladder, Gallbladder (face to feet)

## How Meridians Work in TCM Theory

Traditional Chinese Medicine views health as balanced qi flow through meridians. When meridians are:

**Open and Flowing:** Health, vitality, and balance
**Blocked or Stagnant:** Pain, illness, and dysfunction

Acupuncture works by stimulating specific points along meridians to:
- Remove blockages
- Regulate qi flow
- Restore balance

## Modern Scientific Perspective

Western science hasn't identified anatomical structures corresponding exactly to meridians. However, research has found interesting correlations:

- Meridian pathways often follow nerve distributions
- Acupuncture points show distinct electrical properties
- Some meridians correspond to fascial planes
- Functional MRI shows acupuncture affects specific brain regions

Many practitioners integrate both perspectives—using traditional meridian theory for point selection while understanding physiological mechanisms.

## Common Meridian Imbalances

### Liver Meridian
**Symptoms of imbalance:** Irritability, tension headaches, menstrual issues
**Common causes:** Stress, anger, poor sleep

### Stomach Meridian
**Symptoms of imbalance:** Digestive problems, anxiety, knee pain
**Common causes:** Irregular eating, worry, overthinking

### Kidney Meridian
**Symptoms of imbalance:** Fatigue, back pain, fear, poor concentration
**Common causes:** Overwork, lack of rest, chronic stress

## The Bottom Line

Understanding meridians helps explain how acupuncture addresses health from a whole-body perspective. Whether viewed through traditional TCM theory or modern research, the meridian system provides a framework for effective treatment.

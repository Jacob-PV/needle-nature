A strong immune system is your best defense against illness. Acupuncture offers an evidence-based approach to supporting immune function and maintaining wellness year-round.

## How Acupuncture Supports Immunity

Research shows acupuncture affects immune function through several mechanisms:

**White Blood Cell Activity:** Studies demonstrate acupuncture can increase natural killer cell activity and lymphocyte production.

**Anti-Inflammatory Effects:** Acupuncture helps regulate inflammatory responses, preventing both under and overactive immune reactions.

**Stress Hormone Reduction:** By lowering cortisol, acupuncture removes a major immune suppressant.

**Circulation Enhancement:** Improved blood flow helps immune cells reach where they're needed.

## Preventive Acupuncture for Wellness

### Seasonal Treatments

Many people receive acupuncture treatments at seasonal transitions:

**Fall/Winter:** Strengthen defensive qi before cold and flu season
**Spring:** Support the body through allergy season
**Summer:** Maintain balance during heat stress

### Treatment Approach

Preventive immune support typically involves:
- Monthly treatments during healthy periods
- Increased frequency (weekly) during high-risk times
- 30-45 minute sessions focused on immune enhancement
- Point selections based on individual constitution

## Key Acupuncture Points for Immunity

### Stomach 36 (ST36) - Leg Three Mile
- Tonifies qi and boosts overall vitality
- Supports digestive health (crucial for immunity)
- Strengthens disease resistance

### Lung 7 (LU7) - Broken Sequence
- Strengthens respiratory system
- Protects against external pathogens
- Opens nasal passages

### Large Intestine 4 (LI4) - Union Valley
- Boosts defensive qi
- Relieves symptoms when illness begins
- Strengthens immune response

## Integrating with Lifestyle

For optimal immune function, combine acupuncture with:

**Nutrition:**
- Warm, cooked foods that support digestion
- Adequate protein for immune cell production
- Vitamin-rich fruits and vegetables

**Sleep:**
- 7-9 hours nightly
- Consistent sleep schedule
- Dark, cool sleeping environment

**Exercise:**
- Moderate activity (30 minutes daily)
- Balance between movement and rest
- Avoid overtraining (suppresses immunity)

**Stress Management:**
- Meditation or mindfulness practice
- Adequate downtime and relaxation
- Social connection and support

## When to Seek Treatment

### Preventively
- Monthly wellness treatments
- Before travel (especially international)
- During seasonal transitions
- When under unusual stress

### At Illness Onset
- First signs of cold or flu
- Allergies beginning to flare
- Feeling "run down" or depleted

Early intervention often shortens illness duration and severity.

## Research Evidence

Multiple studies support acupuncture's immune benefits:
- Enhanced natural killer cell activity
- Increased immunoglobulin production
- Improved white blood cell counts
- Reduced inflammatory markers

## Safety Considerations

Acupuncture for immune support is very safe. However:
- Inform your practitioner of all medications
- Those with autoimmune conditions should discuss treatment goals
- Acupuncture supports but doesn't replace vaccines or medical care

## The Bottom Line

Acupuncture offers a proactive approach to immune health. Rather than waiting for illness, regular treatments help maintain strong immune function and resilience year-round.
